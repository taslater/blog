              Wordle is a word game where you're given six guesses to find a
              five letter word. (Play it
              <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">here</a>.) This
              article gives away all the answers to Wordle and explains how I
              ruined this fun game for myself. Click below to spoil your own
              fun!

            <h2>How does this work?</h2>
            <p>
              I like Wordle. I read about it
              <a
                href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html"
                >in the NYT</a
              >
              like everybody else. I also read a little about the developer
              there. He sounds like a nice guy so I decided to dig through his
              code and hack the game he wrote for his partner.
            </p>
            <p>Looking at the source code we notice two things:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                This javascript has been processed by Babel and a bundler.
              </li>
              <li>There are two giant lists of five-letter words.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Bundled and minified JavaScript is unpleasant to read but not
              impossible. I&#39;m not experieced enough to guess what framework
              was used, but I&#39;d love to hear from someone who knows!

            <h2>Two long lists of words</h2>
            <p>
              One list is full of common words and <em>not</em> alphabetized:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">var Aa = [
  "cigar",
  "rebut",
  "sissy",
  "humph",
  "awake",
  ...
]</code></pre>
            <p>
              The other list is full of suspicious-looking words and
              <em>is</em> alphabetized.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">var La = [
  "aahed",
  "aalii",
  "aargh",
  "aarti",
  "abaca",

              So there you go: don&#39;t look if you don&#39;t want to know. The
              first list is every possible answer to the puzzle and the other is
              every guess that Wordle won&#39;t reject (it won&#39;t accept the
              guess &quot;AEIOU&quot;).

              Picking the daily solution from the list
            </h2>
            <p>
              Are you ready to really ruin Wordle for yourself? How does Wordle
              select
              <em>today&#39;s</em> solution from the array of every possible
              solution?
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">// June 19, 2021
var Ra = new Date(2021, 5, 19, 0, 0, 0, 0);
// Pa(today) = # days since June 19, 2021
// modulo the number of possible solutions
// (Aa is the array of every possible solution)
function Pa(e) {
  var a,
    s = Na(e);
  return (a = s % Aa.length), Aa[a];
}
// Subtracts June 19, 2021 from "e"
// to get the number of days since
function Na(e) {
  return $a(Ra, e);
}
// Returns number of days "a" is
// later than "e"
function $a(e, a) {
  var s = new Date(e),
    t = new Date(a).setHours(0, 0, 0, 0) - s.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  return Math.floor(t / 864e5);
}</code></pre>
            <p>
              It counts the days since June 19, 2021 (Wordle&#39;s launch date?)
              and reduces modulo the number of possible solutions to get the
              array index.
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words, it goes through the list in order. Open the source
              code and find the array. Find today&#39;s solution. Tomorrow&#39;s
              is next. Now you know every Wordle solution to eternity (or until
              the source changes).
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, FWIW it seems your current Wordle solution depends on your
              timezone!
